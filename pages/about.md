## Short bio

I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [LIPN](http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr), the CS lab of [Université Sorbonne Paris Nord (Paris 13)](https://www.univ-paris13.fr/), France. My areas of interest are unsupervised machine learning and big data processing. I like to develop and apply advanced algorithms on large, complex industrial data sets. At the same time, I work at [Safran Aircraft Engines](https://www.safran-aircraft-engines.com/), a leading aircraft engine manufacturer and part of Safran, one of the world's largest technology groups.
In 2017, I graduated from [ISAE-Supaero](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/) engineering school in Toulouse, one of the top French "grande école", with a specialization in data and decision sciences and aerospace engineering.
Apart from data science, AI and technology in general, I love music (especially classical, playing the piano) and tennis (mostly on TV but sometimes on the court).

You can find my publications [here](publications), and my full CV is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florent-forest).
